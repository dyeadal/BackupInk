# BackupInk
_Work in Progress. Don't mind the dust :broom:_

I am a current undergraduate student, studying Cyber Security, this is my first attempt in contributing open source software. Additionally, this is my first attempt at creating software that is useful AND not an assignment for a course. Unfortunately my educational path only introduced programming and scripting, and I want to obtain the ability to create useful scripts and programs that make managing my own environment (and hopefully yours) easier. 

My goals for this personal project, is to be able to :

- Create backups of directories/storage devices
- Back up files incrementally.
- Review disrepencies via hashsum and timestamps
- Export disrepencies and/or changes to an XML file


---

## To Do List :scroll: 
 - Add or append a common usage .MD or section.  
 - Loop function to store paths of files and their MD5 hashsums.
 - While loop to recursively list and store directory values.
 - List disrepencies OR State if no difference in arrays (list array differences).
 - Save changes to an XML file prior to initating backup, as a forensic log.
 - Copy file functions of missing or modified files.
 
 ## Researching to Possibly Implement :test_tube: 
 - Research for running MD5 hashsums is efficient for either: 
   - Python executing OS commands.
     OR
   - Python file manipulation and module to create a hashsum.
