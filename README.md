# BackupInk
_Work in Progress. Don't mind the dust :broom:_

- Create backups of directories/storage devices
- Back up files incrementally.
- Review disrepencies via hashsum and timestamps
- Export disrepencies and/or changes to an XML file


---

## To Do List :scroll: 
 - Add or append a common usage .MD or section.  
 - Loop function to store paths of files and their MD5 hashsums.
 - While loop to recursively list and store directory values.
 - List disrepencies OR State if no difference in arrays (list array differences).
 - Save changes to an XML file prior to initating backup, as a forensic log.
 - Copy file functions of missing or modified files.
 
 ## Researching to Possibly Implement :test_tube: 
 - How to and if to use OOP practices for this application.
 - Research for running MD5 hashsums is efficient for either: 
   - Python executing built in OS commands.
   - Python reading the file itself and using an MD5 module.
