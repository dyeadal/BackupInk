# IncBackup
Incrementally back up files to an existing folder.
_Work in Progress. Don't mind the dust :)_

:scroll: ## To Do :scroll:

 - Loop function to store paths of files and their MD5 hashsums
 - While loop to recursively list and store directory values
 - List disrepencies OR State if no difference in arrays (list array differences)
 - Save changes to an XML file prior to initating backup, as a forensic log
 - Copy file functions of missing or modified files
 
 :microscope: ## Researching to Possibly implement :test_tube:
 - How to and if to use OOP practices for this application
 - Research if either Python executing OS commands or Python manipulating data itself is better for running MD5 hashsum command in Python
